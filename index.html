        Welcome to DISKS! DISKS is a two-person puzzle game, so you'll need to grab a friend.
        <br>
        <br>
        In DISKS, you control one color of disk (the default being blue), and you must move your disks
        to victory! Disks move the maximum distance either horizontally or vertically. A visual indicator
        will help you if you touch a disk, like shown below with the disk in the bottom center.
        <br>

        <br>
        In DISKS, there are three patterns you can move your pieces into to win the game. Take note that
        each of these methods include one or more corners, so securing a corner is extremely important
        for winning the game, and making sure your opponent doesn't! These patterns are shown in order
        of increasing difficulty.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first of these patterns is a 2x2 cube in any corner of the board. Forming a cube that's not in
        a corner is impressive, but it doesn't win the game! An example is shown below with the blue color.
        <br>
        <img width="452" height="452" src="assets/example-2.png">
        <br>
        The second of these patterns is a 4x1 line along any of the edges. Like the previous method, the line
        must be on an edge to win the game. An example is shown below with the blue color.
        <br>
        <img width="452" height="452" src="assets/example-3.png">
        <br>
        The third, and most difficult, pattern to win the game is having a disk in each corner of the map. Again,
        an example is shown below with the blue color.
        <br>
        <img width="452" height="452" src="assets/example-4.png">
        <br>
        That's all there is to DISKS! Over time, you'll develop strategies and play styles, but that's best left
        to discovering on your own. Hope you enjoy DISKS!
